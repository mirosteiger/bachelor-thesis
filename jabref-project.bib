  abstract   = {Fire fighting is an extremely physiologically and psychologically demand-
ing occupation, requiring tremendous resources for training personnel as well as
incurring significant workplace safety and insurance board (WSIB) costs. Approxi-
mately 33% of fire fighter injuries result from exposure to fire leading to the possibil-
ity of reducing these injuries through training fire fighters to make better decisions,
particularly when under stress. Simulation (and virtual simulation in particular) offers
a safe and cost-effective alternative to practice with real fire, offering entry level train-
ing to aid fire fighters to reach a specific competency level. With the ubiquity of video
game play and advent of new consumer-level physical interfaces for video games
(e.g., the Nintendo Wii Fit balance-board and the Microsoft Kinect), serious games
(games whose primary purpose is education and training), are able to provide users
with innovative interactive techniques that are highly engaging and immersive. This
paper reviews the development of serious games and virtual simulation applications
that may be utilized for training in the fire service. Current technology allows for the
simulation of fire spread and smoke movement along with training certain fire fight-
ing skills and incident command co-ordination. To date, gaming technology is not
capable of providing a real world scenario that is completely and faithfully accurate
in a dynamic virtual environment. Future work could utilize serious games to also
recreate the decision making processes and the physical requirements that fire fighters
encounter in an emergency situation. These could be incorporated into a simulation
environment where the physical and psychological stresses are analogous to live fire
fighting situations.},
